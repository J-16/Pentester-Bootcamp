# _Write an HTTP client to retrieve the home page of your site using a socket._

<br>


Here we will learn how to make a simple http request using a socket library to the server that we created earlier and access the data in the terminal.

>Python

You can find the program [here](./http-client-socket.py)

If you are confused by this line.
```
s.sendall(b"GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: 192.168.149.128\r\n\r\n")
```
don't worry we will get to know why we need to send ```GET```, ```HTTP```, ```HOST```  in the next lesson where we start to use [Burp suite](./5.%20burp_suite.md)
