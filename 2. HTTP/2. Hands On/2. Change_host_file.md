# _Change your host file to access the Linux system under the following names: vulnerable._

<br>

In order to access our IP address under the name _vulnerable_ we need to make some changes to our hosts file.
In Ubuntu machine, run the following command

```
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```
/etc/hosts is the file which translates the hostname or domain name to IP addresses.

The output will be something like this:

<img  style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:80%;" src="./etc_hosts.png">

<br>

In the previous lesson we accessed the web page using ```127.0.0.1``` and ```localhost``` as well. So, here you can see the reason, that was because the ip address 127.0.0.1 is mapped to localhost. In the next line you can see the address 127.0.1.1 is address to ubuntu, yes you can access the same web page with ```127.0.1.1``` or ```ubuntu```.

You can either change the localhost to ```vulnerable``` or in new line we can map the name ```vulnerable``` to the IP.

<img  style="display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; width:80%;" src="./etc_hosts%20_change.png">

<br>

Once you have made the changes press ```CONTROL+X```, when asked if you to _Save modified buffer_, press ```y```.
 
 Now if you try to reach http://vulnerable from your browser, you will finally see the same Default apache webpage.

(_ ```sudo``` : for permission <br> ```nano```: text editor, here we use to change the file_)

Now try the same process with the KALI Linux machine. Try to access with different name and play around. Edit the host file with _vim_. If the changes doesn't reflect back in any of the above steps try 
```
service apache2 restart
```

Now if you want to access the IP with a custom name from your host machine i.e, In Windows, 

Open Notepad as administrator<br>
Open the file c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts<br>
Then do the changes as we did in Linux machine and save the changes.<br>
Navigate to the name you have used in the browser<br>
