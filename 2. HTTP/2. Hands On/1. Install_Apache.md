>### What is Apache?

<br>

Apache (Apache HTTP Server) is a cross platform web server.

<br>

As stated in [Linux and Scripting](../../1.%20Linux%20and%20Scripting!/2.%20Hands%20On/) section we have agreed on 3 OS. So here we will be using Ubuntu 16 and Kali Linux 2019

> KALI Linux

Kali Linux is pre installed with apache server.

Open terminal and run the following command:
```
which apache2
```
Output will be something like this:
```
/usr/sbin/apache2
```
So, we confirm Apache is installed.

(_ ```which``` command is used to find the location of a executable file_)

Now run the following command:
```
ls /var
```
Here, the output will be all the files/directories located in _var_ folder. Try to identify the ```www``` directory. This is the root directory of the apache web server.

(_ ```ls``` is used to list files/directory_)

Now, we need to know out IP address, for that run the following command: 
```
ip addr show
```
From the output get the IP address(in my case it is 192.168.149.128, you will have a different IP address), now open a browser and enter the IP address.

There will be no output since the apache server is not started yet.

So, we need to start our apache to see the result in the browser. Run the following command :
```
service apache2 start
```

Now, if you refresh the browser. Default Apache web server will be displayed.

> Ubuntu

In Ubuntu no server is installed by default. So we will be installing apache server in our ubuntu machine.
First lets check if apache is installed by the same command we used previously:
```
which apache2
```
So, the output will be empty, meaning no such executable was found by the ```which``` command.
Also get the IP address as we did earlier, ```ip addr show``` and navigate to the IP in the browser. Since there is no web server installed the browser won't be able to reach the IP.

Now we will install apache2.
Run the following command:
```
sudo apt install apache2
```
This will install apache2 server.Now if you refresh your browser, you will be able to see the Default apache web page as you saw in the KALI machine before.

(_ ```sudo``` : Is used to run a command as another user (by default superuser),<br>
```apt install``` : to install any packages) 
NOTE: try installing without _sudo_ and see what is the output.

```
apt install apache2
```
<br>

You can also use ```127.0.0.1``` or ```localhost``` in the virtual machine to view the same.
You need the IP address to access the website out your machine. Now from your host machine (in my case it is windows), if you enter IP address of Ubuntu or KALI machine you will be able to see Same Default apache web page in the host as well. This is because all the VMs and Host are in the same network.
Now if you use ```127.0.0.1``` or ```localhost``` in your host. The browser won't be able reach the server, this is because the Host machine doesn't have any web server running or installed.
