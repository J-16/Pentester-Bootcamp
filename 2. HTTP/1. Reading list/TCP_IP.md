>### What is TCP?IP?

<br>

TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.TCP/IP is the implementation of [OSI MODEL](./OSI%20model.md). TCP/IP determines how a computer should be connected to the internet and how data should be transmitted.

TCP/IP is the most commonly used protocol suite in the web. You do not need to set it up manually, as TCP/IP is build in as a standard.The Internet protocol suite provides end-to-end data communication specifying how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received.

>### Layers

<br>

There are 4 layers in TCP/IP model unlike 7 in [OSI model](./OSI%20model.md)

>### Application Layer

<br>

Application Layer interacts with the Application/Software.These Applications are the one which end users relay on. Strictly these application are not the part of the ```Application Layers```, instead Application Layer consists of the protocols and data manipulation of those Application. Example, Browser. It consists of the protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, TFTP, Telnet, SSH, SMTP, SNM.

If we look closer into the Application Layer it does the functions of the three layers of the [OSI layer](OSI%20model.md) (Application, Presentation, Session).

>### Transport Layer

<br>

Transport Layer is responsible for end to end communication between two device. Transport Layers are either [TCP](./TCP.md)(connection oriented) or UDP(connection less).  It is also responsible for breaking the data into segments and numbers each of them to make a sequence. So, at the receiving end it make sure that each segment is in correct order. So, Transport Layer is responsible for flow control and error control.

<br>

>### Internet Layer

<br>

The Internet Layer is responsible for sending data from one network to another. It breaks segments into packets and at the receiving end these packets are reassembled. Internet Layer also finds the best possible path for the data.

<br>

>### Network Interface Layer

<br>

Network Interface Layers determines how the data should be sent physically(Ethernet cable, wireless network, network interface card) through the network. This Layer is responsible for the transmission of the data in a same network.
