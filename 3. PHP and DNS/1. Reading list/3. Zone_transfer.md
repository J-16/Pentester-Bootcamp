>### What is zone transfer? 

Zone transfer is the process of coping the contents from one server to another. (replicate from primary server to secondary server)

>### Is Zone Transfer safe?

Any client can ask a DNS server for a copy of the entire zone. This means that unless some kind of protection is introduced, an attacker can get a list of all hosts for a domain, which gives them a lot of potential attack vectors.

I highly recommend to read the article in the Further reading section.

NOTE: We will implement and check the workings soon.
