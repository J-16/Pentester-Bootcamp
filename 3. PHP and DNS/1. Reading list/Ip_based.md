### IP-based VHosting is hosting two website on single server.

<br>

```
http://website3.com
or 
http://192.168.149.145
```

<br>

Check the Network Interface Device name

```
ifconfig -a
or
ip addr
```

- Add new IP address. (eg: eth, ens, enp)

(In my case it is ens)

```
sudo ifconfig ens33:1 192.168.149.145 up
```

- Let's create a root directory for our next website.

```
sudo mkdir /var/www/website3
```

- Create index.html file inside /var/www/website3 and paste [index.html](./index.html). (inside the index file change the contents from ```website1``` to ```website3```)

- Create a folder (website3.conf) inside /etc/apache2/sites-available.

```
sudo mkdir /etc/apache2/sites-available/website3.conf 
```

- Paste these inside the configuration file

```
<VirtualHost 192.168.149.134>
    ServerName website4.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/website4
</VirtualHost>
```

- Enable the website that we added:

```
sudo a2ensite website4.conf
```

- Restart server

```
sudo service apache2 reload
```

- Add domain to host

Map website4.com to the IP 192.168.149.145

Now visit,

```
http://192.168.149.145

Output:
Welcome to Website3
```

NOTE : So previously we did port based, we can also combine IP and PORT together.

TO-DO : Create a new website, access it via new ip and port.

eg : if you visit 192.168.149.160:8089, you should get 

```
Welcome to Website at 160:8089
```
