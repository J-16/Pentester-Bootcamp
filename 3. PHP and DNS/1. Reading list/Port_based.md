### Port-based VHosting is hosting two website on single server.

So, we are going to create and access these 2 domains in our sever.

```
http://website4.com:8080
```

Which is also same as

```
http://192.168.149.132:8080
```

- Let's create a root directory for our next website.

```
sudo mkdir /var/www/website4
```

- Create index.html file inside /var/www/website4 and paste [index.html](./index.html). (inside the index file change the contents from ```website1``` to ```website4```)

- Create a folder (website4.conf) inside /etc/apache2/sites-available.

```
sudo mkdir /etc/apache2/sites-available/website4.conf 
```

- Paste these inside the configuration file

```
<VirtualHost 192.168.149.132:8080>
    ServerName website4.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/website4
</VirtualHost>
```

- Enable the website that we added:
```
sudo a2ensite website4.conf
```

- Finally add the port 8080 in ports.conf file

```
sudo nano port.conf
```
```
Listen 8080
```

<br>

- Restart server

```
sudo service apache2 reload
```

- Add domain to host

Map website4.com to the IP 192.168.149.132 


Now visit,

```
http://website4.com:8080
http://192.168.149.132:8080

Output:
Welcome to Website4
```

NOTE: Just for understanding purpose we added website4 as new domain, if you check the host file we have previously mapped same IP to ```website1```. So, even if we visit website1.com:8080 we will get the same output as above.
