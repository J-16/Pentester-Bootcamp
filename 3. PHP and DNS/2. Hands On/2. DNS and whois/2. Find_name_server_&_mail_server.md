# __Find what name servers are used by PentesterLab, find what Mail servers are used by pentesterlab and find the Ip address of www.pentesterlab.com__

<br />


> Find the IP address of www.pentesterlab.com

Basic command to get the IP address (dig example.com)

```
dig pentesterlab.com
```

The above command will most probably will give only the IP address. Also we can pass an option __A__. (dig example.com A)

<br />

> Find what name servers are used by PentesterLab

For this we will pass an options (NS) (dig example.com NS)

```
dig pentesterlab.com NS 
```

<br />

> Find what Mail servers are used by pentesterlab

Again, for this there's a tag (MX) (dig example.com MX)

```
dig pentesterlab.com MX
```

<br />

> All the above in single command

dig example.com ANY 

```
dig pentesterlab.com ANY
```

<br />
