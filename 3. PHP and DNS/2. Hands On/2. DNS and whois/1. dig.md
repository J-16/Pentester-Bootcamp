# __Install the command line tool dig in your vm.__


<br />

Remember this tool? We have read about this in the [Zone Transfer](../../1.%20Reading%20list/3.%20Zone_transfer.md). So here we will see more about this.

By default dig is installed on both the OS we choose at the beginning i.e, ubuntu and kali.

But for any reason if dig is not found. 

```
sudo apt install dnsutils
```
