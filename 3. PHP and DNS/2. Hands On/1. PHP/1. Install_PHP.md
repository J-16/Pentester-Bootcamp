# _Install PHP in your virtual machine (using your previous Apache installation), write a script that echoes back a parameter in the URL. For example, accessing http://vulnerable/hello.php?name=Louis will return "Hello Louis"._

For this section, we will be working with PHP and SQL. I have tried to explain the syntax and basics which is used in this section alone. I highly recommend to read the ```further reading``` section to learn about PHP and SQL beyond the scope of this section, which will be very useful on further sections.

We need to install PHP and PHP module for apache.

- Installation :

```
sudo apt install php
sudo apt install libapache2-mod-php
```

- Also restart server. 
  
```
sudo service apache2 restart
```

As we have installed PHP and required modules, next we have to create a php file. 

- Now inside our root directory(/var/www/html/) we will create a file(hello.php).

```
sudo touch /var/www/html/hello.php
```

- Lets open the file and write our first PHP code.
  
##### (if you want to learn more about PHP please refer ```further reading``` section)

<br />

```
sudo nano hello.php
```

##### type ```sudo nano h``` and press ```tab```. (Use this whenever if you don't want to type the file name fully)

- Add these line

```
<?php echo "welcome"; ?>
```

This is a simple PHP script. All the PHP code will be enclosed with in ```<?php``` and  ```?>```. Here ```echo``` is a function which will print the followed by text. And finally every PHP statement will end with a semicolon (;)

- Now visit the webpage we just created at http://vulnerable/hello.php

The output will be something like this.

'''
welcome
'''
<br />

## Working with parameters.

<br />

Recall GET request. GET request is when a client asks some data from the server. So, here instead of directly requesting some data from the server we are going to pass some parameters in the URL.

Here, we will send some query like this : http://vulnerable/hello.php?name=myname

This is very simple like a key value pair. ```?key=value```

So, with PHP we are going to the get the parameter value of the name (value of the key), and print the same.

Now, instead of ```welcome``` we will print the value that is passed by the client.

##### $_GET["key"] : This syntax is used to get the parameters key and value. So in place of key we need to give the actual key value we are looking for, here it is "name".

```
$_GET["name"]
```

- Now we'll modify our hello.php to echo the value.

```
<?php
echo $_GET["name"];
?>
```

- Finally send the parameter in the URL : http://vulnerable/hello.php?name=myname

```
myname
```

<br />

- Now pass some other parameter 
  
  example :```<script>alert("You have been hacked")</script>```

So, the Url will look something like this

```
http://vulnerable/hello.php?name=<script>alert("You have been hacked")</script>
```

Excited?, Hold your breadth we will see those amazing exploits and techniques in upcoming section.
