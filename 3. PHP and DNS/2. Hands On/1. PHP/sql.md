> BASICS

Database − A database is a collection of tables, with related data.

Table − A table is a matrix with data. A table in a database looks like a simple spreadsheet.

Column − One column (data element) contains data of one and the same kind, for example the column postcode.

Row − A row (= tuple, entry or record) is a group of related data, for example the data of one subscription.

Primary Key − A primary key is unique. A key value can not occur twice in one table. With a key, you can only find one row.
