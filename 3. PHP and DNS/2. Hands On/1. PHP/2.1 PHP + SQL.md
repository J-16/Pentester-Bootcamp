# _Working with PHP and MYSQL_

>### GET data from database
---

<br />

First Let's create a webpage(article.php) in our server directory. (/var/www/html)

<br />

As we know, $_GET is a predefined variable used for such processing.

The information sent in the URL is what we will get in $_GET variable. Example: http://vulnerable/article.php?id=1, here id is the key and 1 is the value.

- We will get the parameter value as we did previously.
  
```
$id=$_GET["id"];
```

- Then, We need to connect to our database in order to get the values stored in it.

```
$connection = new mysqli(url, username, password, database_name);
```

In my case it is: 
```
$connection = new mysqli("localhost", "root", "password", "blog");
```
  
- Now, we'll declare a variable and set up the SQL query:

```
$select = "SELECT * FROM BLOG_LIST WHERE ID=$id";
```

- As we have the query, let's run thee query and save the data in a variable.This will return an array(Recall the output from the MYSQL terminal).

```
$array = $connection->query($select);
```

- Then we will fetch the result and pass to a new variable.

```
$row = $array->fetch_assoc();
```

- Get the __ARTICLE__ from the array and print that

```
echo $row["ARTICLE"];
```

At last [article.php](./article.php) will look something like this.

<br />



Now go to http://vulnerable/article.php, the output will be blank because we didn't any _id_ in the URL. So let's do that, http://vulnerable/article.php?id=1 and see what output you get.

Try to create this PHP file yourself

<details>
<summary>Hint 1:</summary>
<br>

```
INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME VALUES (id, "article")
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2:</summary>
<br>

```
INSERT INTO BLOG_LIST VALUES ($ID,'$ARTICLE')
```
</details>

[create.php](./create.php)

Even if you don't want to create a html file, it is totally fine. Just a plain PHP as in the Above steps is enough. But you just need to send all the data to the server in the URL itself.
like : http://vulnerable/create.php?ID=3&ARTICLE=football
Each time you need to change the ID, remember why? It is because we have stated ID as primary key, so it is unique.

Once you create you can get the newly created ID via http://vulnerable/article.php?id=3
