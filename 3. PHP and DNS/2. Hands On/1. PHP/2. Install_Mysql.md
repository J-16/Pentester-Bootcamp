# _Install Mysql and create a script that retrieves information from it, like article.php?id=1 returns a book and article.php?id=2 returns a computer._

---

<br />

- Installation:

```
sudo apt install mysql-server
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

[SomeBasics...](sql.md)

First command is for installing MySQL and second will configure some default security option.

Press ```y + Enter``` wherever needed and give the root password.

<br />
Enter the MySQL :

```
sudo mysql -p
or
sudo mysql -u root -p
```
It prompts for password, enter the password and press enter.

- Restart the server
  
```
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

We'll create a database for our blog. So our database name will be ```blog```

- First, let's create a Database 

```
CREATE DATABASE blog;
```

- Now let's view the database that we created 

```
SHOW DATABASES;
```
NOTE: Don't forget Semicolon.

- select the database 

```
USE blog;
```

- Now we need a table with name _BLOG_LIST_.

```
CREATE TABLE BLOG_LIST(
  ID INT NOT NULL, 
  ARTICLE VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL, 
  PRIMARY KEY (ID));
```

Inside the table we have created a column _ID_ to uniquely identify each items and another column ARTICLE to store each item name. _INT_ and _VARCHAR_ are the data type of the respective columns meaning _ID_ is a integer value and ARTICLE is character value. _NOT NULL_ states that the column cannot be empty. By default column _ID_ is not unique and can contain value of an other record, So finally _PRIMARY KEY_ is used to defined that column _ID_ is used to identify each record uniquely.  

- Let's now check the table that we just created.

```
DESC BLOG_LIST;
```

- Now, lets add data to our tables.

  - INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...);)
  <br /> or <br />
  - INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME VALUES (value1,value2,value3,...);)

```
INSERT INTO BLOG_LIST (ID, ARTICLE) VALUES (1,'book'),(2,'computer');
or 
INSERT INTO BLOG_LIST VALUES (1,'book'),(2,'computer');
```

or add individually by 

```
INSERT INTO BLOG_LIST (ID, ARTICLE) VALUES (1,'book');
INSERT INTO BLOG_LIST (ID, ARTICLE) VALUES (2,'computer');
or 

INSERT INTO BLOG_LIST VALUES (1,'book');
INSERT INTO BLOG_LIST VALUES (2,'computer');
```

- View the table 

To get the full column details : (SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME)
```
SELECT * FROM BLOG_LIST;
```
Output
```
+----+-----------+
| ID |  ARTICLE  |
+----+-----------+
|  1 | book      |
|  2 | computer  |
+----+-----------+
```


> Try these and see what output you get:

<br />

ALSO using __WHERE__:

SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE COLUMN = value

```
SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE ID = 1;
or
SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE ARTICLE = "book";
```

<br />
To get values of one column : SELECT COLUMN FROM TABLE_NAME

```
SELECT ARTICLE FROM BLOG_LIST
```

TO get values of one row : SELECT COLUMN FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE COLUMN = value;

```
SELECT ARTICLE FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE ID = 1;
or 
SELECT ID FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE ARTICLE="book";
```

#### We have just learned some basics about SQL, next up we will get the blog information from our database and display the same on our webpage using PHP.
---

<br />

Alternatively you can do the same with [PHPMYADMIN](./phpmyadmin.md) which is a GUI. BUT i strongly recommend you with follow the above steps and learn more about SQL, which will be very use full while learning SQL-Injection in the upcoming sections.
