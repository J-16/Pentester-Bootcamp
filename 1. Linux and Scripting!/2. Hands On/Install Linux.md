# _Install Linux: Retrieve a virtualisation system (VirtualBox, VM player) and install Linux. Use a traditional distribution like Ubuntu not a security related one._

<br/>

Use a  virtualisation system for testing purpose, So if you make any mistake it is always the virtual machine data that is affect. You can have as many as you want.

Download any or both of the software as per your wish:

- [virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- [vmware](https://my.vmware.com/en/group/vmware/downloads/details?downloadGroup=PLAYER-1610&productId=1039&rPId=55792)

The installation is pretty straight forward.

Once the virtual machine is installed now it's time to choose our operating system. I would suggest to go with a Debian based:
- [Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
  
But if you want to try any other distribution please feel free to use that.
