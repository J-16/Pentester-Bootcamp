# _Install Linux: Retrieve a virtualisation system (VirtualBox, VM player) and install Linux. Use a traditional distribution like Ubuntu not a security related one._

<br/>

Use a  virtualization system for testing purpose, So if you make any mistake it is always the virtual machine data that is affect. You can have as many as you want.

Download any or both of the software as per your wish:

- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
- [VMware](https://my.vmware.com/en/group/vmware/downloads/details?downloadGroup=PLAYER-1610&productId=1039&rPId=55792)

The installation is pretty straight forward.

Once the virtual machine is installed now it's time to choose our operating system. I would suggest to go with a Debian based:

- [Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
  
But if you want to try any other distribution please feel free to use that.

Now, for the sake of testing and learning let's go with ```3 virtual machines```.

- Ubuntu 20.o4
- Ubuntu 16.04
- Kali Linux 2019.2
Again you can go with any other distro of your choice.

Here, the installation of the OS in either VirtualBox or VMware is pretty straight forward. Even though if you are new here is the link:
