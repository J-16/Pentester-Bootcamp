Basically DNS is the phone book of Internet. DNS maintains a list of _domain names_ with their respective IP addresses.

>### What is Domain name?
<br/>

Simply Domain names are human readable address. 

One can reach any server with the Public IP(172.217.168.196) address, computers can handle such address easily. But it will be difficult for the humans to know which IP address belongs to which server and what information it contains. So to overcome these issues, domain name is used.

>>How a domain name look?
```
one.example.com
```
It is read from right to left. The Right most is the TLD (Top Level Domain). The follow ups are domain (Second-Level-Domain) or label.

To make it easy, lets remember like this: either ```domain``` term or ```label``` term

__com__ : Top Level Domain (TLD) [other TLD are .net, .in, .co, .uk, etc]

__example__ : domain _or_ label 1 

__one__ : subdomain _or_ label 2

<br/>

- Type mozilla.org in your browser's location bar.
- Your browser asks your computer if it already recognizes the IP address identified by this domain name (using a local DNS cache). If it does, the name is translated to the IP address and the browser negotiates contents with the web server. End of story.
- If your computer does not know which IP is behind the mozilla.org name, it goes on to ask a DNS server, whose job is precisely to tell your computer which IP address matches each registered domain name.
- Now that the computer knows the requested IP address, your browser can negotiate contents with the web server.
