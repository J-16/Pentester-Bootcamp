#First we import a socket library which has all the functionality which is required for us to make a simple server
import socket

#HOST is a variable that holds a IP adress to which we are want to connect
HOST = '192.168.149.142'

# PORT is a variable that holds which PORT number we are want to connect
PORT = 8088

# clientSocket is a variable which holds socket.socket() function which creates a socket Object. we Then pass two arguments to the function 
# first arguments states the address family which is AF_INET in this case, AF_INET is the address family for IPv4
# second argument states the socket type, here SOCK_STREAM is TCP.
clientSocket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

#now we connect to the server with connect() function by passing the IP and PORT as an argument to which we want to server
clientSocket.connect((HOST,PORT))

#finally we display the message from the server
print(clientSocket.recv(1024))
