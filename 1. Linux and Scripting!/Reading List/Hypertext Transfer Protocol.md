>### What is http?

<br/>

_The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser._ --[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)

<br/>

_Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests._ _[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP)_

<br/>

HTTP provides a general framework for access control and authentication.__[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication)__

>### CORS (_Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)_)

<br/>

_Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any other origins (domain, scheme, or port) than its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources. CORS also relies on a mechanism by which browsers make a “preflight” request to the server hosting the cross-origin resource, in order to check that the server will permit the actual request. In that preflight, the browser sends headers that indicate the HTTP method and headers that will be used in the actual request._ _[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)_
