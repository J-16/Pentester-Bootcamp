In simple terms ```HTTP``` is responsible for the communication between web __servers__ and __clients__.

HTTP Requests and Response are the two major parts of the communication.

Example : 

When you visit ```https://github.com/```, a REQUEST is made by the _client_ to the _server_.  (The client requests the server to send the homepage of github in this case.)

Then the server responds by sending the requested document(homepage). 
REQUEST and RESPONSE of the above exmaple:
REQUEST 
>```
>GET / HTTP/1.1
>Host: github.com
>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:84.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/84.0
>Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
>Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
>```

- __GET__ : method (Operation that client wants to perform) 
- __/__ : path (files or documents that client wants to fetch) 
- __HTTP/1.1__ : version of HTTP protocol
- __headers__ : Host, User_Agent, Accept, Accept-Lanugage, etc are the Headers (There are many headers been sent, i have shown only few)

> In the above example "/" path refers to the default homepage in the server.

> When you make request to ```https://github.com/pricing``` Then the path will be "/pricing".

RESPONSE 
>```
>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
>date: Wed, 30 Dec 2020 07:30:30 GMT
>content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8
>server: GitHub.com
>
> <!DOCTYPE html>
><html lang="en" class="html-fluid">
>  <head> ... 
></html>
>```

- __HTTP/1.1__ : version of HTTP protocol
- __200__ :  Status Code (indicates where the request which was made is successfull or not)
- __OK__ : Status message (Short description of the Status code)
- __headers__ : date, content-type, server, etc are Headers for the response
- __Body__ : the body conatins the document (which is the requested github homepage in this case)

>NOTE: Here HTTPS stands for HyperText Tranfer Protocol Secure. We will see more about HTTPS while learning TLS and SSL. For time being just know that HTTPS is an added security for HTTP.

HTTP method : (source [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods))

These are some of the common Methods you wil face daily.

GET
- The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.

POST
- The POST method is used to submit an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.

PUT
- The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.

DELETE
- The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.

Curious how HTTP works ?

So it's always good to learn form scratch.Go to [HTTP Server](https://github.com/GJ-16/HttpServer) (build a simple http server) to know how HTTP works, what is socket, what is TCP and how all this is reated to each other.
