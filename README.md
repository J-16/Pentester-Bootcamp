# Pentester-Bootcamp
PentesterLab Bootcamp: Everything you need to get started in Infosec

[Original Post](https://pentesterlab.com/bootcamp)

_Bootcamp provides a learning path to get into security and especially web penetration testing.
This course is a list of things to read and do. No solutions are provided since it is, in my opinion, the best and only way to learn. If you don't manage to get one of the items done, just try harder. ```Spend more time googling until you find the solution. Finding something by yourself is the best way to remember it.```_
<br/>

##### *As Stated above please feel free to google and find the solution. If you have tried hard and still unable to get the solution or If you are in short of time then use this repo, because ```Finding something by yourself is the best way to remember it.```*

### __Hands on:__ 
_Install Linux:_ 
- Retrieve a virtualisation system (VirtualBox, VM player) and install Linux. Use a traditional distribution like Ubuntu not a security related one.
- Learn the basics of a scripting language: Pick between Ruby, Python or Perl and learn its syntax and data types. You will need it to keep going.

### __Reading list:__
- TCP/IP
- Secure Sockets Layer
- Keeping notes during a pentest

### __Hands on:__

- Install Apache inside your vm, change the home page of the hosted site using vim. Access this page in your browser (on the host).
- Change your host file to access the Linux system under the following names: vulnerable.
- Write an HTTP client to retrieve the home page of your site using an http library (for example net/http in ruby).
- Write an HTTP client to retrieve the home page of your site using a socket.
- Download Burp Suite (free version) and visit a website and see what requests are sent and what responses are receive.

<br/>

>## __3. PHP and DNS__

### __Reading list:__
- Learn about virtual hosting and how to setup vhosts with Apache
- Zone transfer

### __Hands on:__

_PHP basics:_ 
- Install PHP in your virtual machine (using your previous Apache installation), write a script that echoes back a parameter in the URL. For example, accessing http://vulnerable/hello.php?name=Louis will return "Hello Louis".
- Install Mysql and create a script that retrieves information from it, like article.php?id=1 returns a book and article.php?id=2 returns a computer.
- Create a page that sends data to itself using a POST request.
 
_DNS and whois:_
- Install the command line tool dig in your vm.
- Find what name servers are used by PentesterLab, find what Mail servers are used by pentesterlab and find the Ip address of www.pentesterlab.com
- Obtain information about pentesterlab.com using the whois tool.

<br/>

>## __4. SSL/TLS__
### __Reading list:__
- SQL injection
- XSS

### __Hands on:__
_Setup SSL:_ 
- enable HTTPs on your web server
- make sure you disabled all the weak ciphers.
 
_Play with SSL:_

- write a SSL client using an HTTP library.
- write a SSL client using a socket.
- access your SSL server with your previous HTTP script and socat to do the connection socket<->ssl-socket.
  
<br/>
