PentesterLab Bootcamp: Everything you need to get started in Infosec

[Link to PentesterLab post](https://pentesterlab.com/bootcamp)

_Bootcamp provides a learning path to get into security and especially web penetration testing.
This course is a list of things to read and do. No solutions are provided since it is, in my opinion, the best and only way to learn. If you don't manage to get one of the items done, just try harder. Spend more time googling until you find the solution. Finding something by yourself is the best way to remember it._
